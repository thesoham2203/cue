# cue

**An open-source AI copilot that floats over your screen — sees what you see, hears your meetings, and stays hidden from screen shares.**

A free, self-hosted alternative to Cluely, for **Windows**. Bring your own AI key (OpenAI · Anthropic · Google Gemini · OpenAI-compatible endpoints).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Please read this first.** cue tries to stay out of screen recordings/shares, but this is **best-effort, not guaranteed** — on Windows 10 builds older than 2004 it degrades to a black box instead of true exclusion, and a phone camera pointed at your screen always sees it. Using a hidden assistant during a **proctored exam, job interview, or recorded meeting** may break that platform's rules and, in some places, consent laws. cue is built for legitimate uses — your own notes, studying, accessibility, and practice. **You are responsible for how you use it.**

---

## What it does

cue floats a small glass panel on top of everything. It takes **three separate inputs** — your **screen**, your **microphone**, and your **meeting audio** (what the other person says) — and uses an AI model to help you in real time.

| Feature | How to trigger | What it uses |
|---|---|---|
| **Assist** | `Ctrl` `Enter` (configurable) | your screen + recent conversation |
| **What should I say?** | button | meeting audio + your mic |
| **Follow-up questions** | button | the whole conversation |
| **Recap** | button | the whole conversation |
| **Ask anything** | type + `Enter` | your screen + conversation |
| **Solve a coding problem** | `Ctrl` `H` | your screen only |
| **Smart** toggle | pill in the box | switches to a smarter (slower) model |

It's a copilot for **live meetings** ("what do I say to that?") and **coding problems** (screenshot → full solution), and it's designed to be **invisible in screen shares** so it stays your private assistant.

### Requirements

- **Windows 11**, or **Windows 10 version 2004 (build 19041)** or newer. The "hidden from screen shares" flag (`WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE`) needs build 19041+; older Windows 10 still runs cue but renders a black box in captures instead of truly excluding the window.
- **Microphone permission** — the only OS permission cue needs. Screenshots and meeting audio need no permission and work immediately.
- **An API key** from at least one AI provider (see [Step 2](#step-2--add-your-ai-key-bring-your-own)).

Meeting audio — capturing the *other* person, which powers **What should I say?**, **Follow-up questions**, and **Recap** — uses Windows system-audio loopback and works out of the box.

## Install

Option A is the easiest. Use Option B if you'd rather run from source.

### Option A — Download the installer (easiest)

Go to the [**Releases**](../../releases) page and download **`cue-win-x64.exe`**, then run it. It's a per-user installer, so it never asks for administrator rights and installs cue just for you; launch it from the Start menu afterward.

The installer is **unsigned**, so Windows SmartScreen may show a **"Windows protected your PC" / "Unknown publisher"** warning. Click **More info → Run anyway** to proceed.

### Option B — Run from source

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **22.12+** installed (required by dev dependencies). No Visual Studio build tools required — cue deliberately avoids native modules.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blueturboguy07/cue.git
cd cue
npm install
npm start
```

That's the whole setup. There's no permission dance — grant the mic when Windows asks and you're done.

To build a standalone app:

```bash
npm run pack        # unpacked app     -> dist/win-unpacked/cue.exe
npm run dist:win    # NSIS installer   -> dist/cue-win-x64.exe
```

See **[BUILD.md](BUILD.md)** for the full build-and-package walkthrough (prerequisites, bundling the local whisper runtime, and how the installer is produced).

Packaged builds can include a pinned `whisper.cpp` runtime. When running from source and using **Local** transcription, prepare the matching runtime once:

```bash
npm run prepare:whisper
```

Windows x64 uses a checksum-verified binary from the pinned upstream whisper.cpp release — no compiler or toolchain needed.

## First launch — the 1-minute setup

When cue opens the first time, a **built-in tutorial** walks you through everything below. You can reopen it anytime by clicking the **cue logo** (top-left of the pill). Here's the same thing in writing.

### Step 1 — Grant the microphone

cue can't hear you until Windows lets it. When you first use a listening feature you'll usually be prompted — click **Allow**. If no prompt appears, grant access manually:

Settings → **Privacy & security** → **Microphone** → turn on **Microphone access** *and* **Let desktop apps access your microphone**.

Screenshots and meeting audio need **no permission at all** — they work immediately, using Windows loopback capture.

### Step 2 — Add your AI key (bring your own)

cue uses **your own** API key, so it's free to run (you only pay your AI provider for what you use). Click the **`...`** button in the input box (or press `Ctrl` `,`) to open **Settings**, pick a provider, and paste your key:

| Provider | Get a key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenAI** | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) | One key does everything — **but** for the *listening* features the key must have **Whisper / audio** access (a "restricted" project key that only allows chat will give a 403 on transcription). |
| **Anthropic (Claude)** | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) | Great for screen & coding help. Claude has no speech-to-text, so add an OpenAI or Gemini key too if you want the listening features. |
| **Google Gemini** | [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) | One key does chat + transcription. |
| **Azure AI Foundry** | [ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com) | Paste your **endpoint** plus your key in Settings. **Azure OpenAI:** `https://&lt;resource&gt;.openai.azure.com/openai` — **AI Foundry:** `https://&lt;host&gt;.cognitiveservices.azure.com` (cue appends `/openai/v1` itself). The **model** fields are your deployment names. No speech-to-text — add an OpenAI or Gemini key for listening. |
| **Custom** | Your endpoint or gateway | Any OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint. The API key is optional for unauthenticated local servers. |

To use an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, select **Custom** and configure its Base URL, API key, and Fast/Smart model IDs. Custom endpoints handle LLM requests only; listening continues to use Deepgram, OpenAI, or Gemini credentials.

| Example | Base URL | Model |
|---|---|---|
| OpenClaw local gateway | `http://127.0.0.1:18789/v1` | `openclaw/default` |
| Ollama | `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` | An installed Ollama model ID |

Your key is stored **only on your computer** (in `cue-data.json`) and is sent **only** to that provider. cue has no server and collects nothing.

### Optional — transcribe locally with whisper.cpp

Open **Settings → Audio**, choose **Local**, and download a model. `base.en` is the recommended English default; all 30 models supported by the official whisper.cpp download script are available, including multilingual, quantized, large, turbo, and TinyDiarize variants.

Local mode is independent from the chat provider, so you can use local speech-to-text with OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini chat. The selected model loads once when listening starts, serves both the **You** and **Them** channels, and unloads only after queued speech has been transcribed when listening stops.

- Audio inference stays on your computer and audio is never written to a temporary file.
- Model files are downloaded only when you ask, support cancel/resume, and are checked against pinned byte counts and SHA-256 hashes.
- Local mode never silently sends audio to a cloud fallback. A local failure is reported without sending the audio elsewhere.
- Models are stored under cue's Electron user-data directory and can be imported or deleted from Settings.

### Optional — tailor answers to your background

In **Settings**, paste your résumé or professional background into **Résumé / professional background**. cue uses it as the factual reference for career-related answers and says when the résumé does not provide a detail. You can clear it anytime.

### Step 3 — The Zoom setting (only needed for Zoom)

cue is hidden from most screen-share tools automatically — **Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and QuickTime need nothing.** **Zoom** has a specific setting that decides whether it respects cue's "don't capture me" flag:

> **Zoom → Settings → Share Screen → Advanced → Screen capture mode → choose "Advanced capture with window filtering."**

<div align="center"><img src="docs/zoom-setting.png" width="560" alt="Zoom screen capture mode setting" /></div>

**Why:** the *"...with window filtering"* modes tell Zoom to leave out windows that mark themselves as private — which is exactly what cue does. The **"Advanced capture without window filtering"** mode grabs the raw screen and **will show cue**, so avoid it.

## How to use it

- **`Ctrl` `Enter` — Assist.** The do-the-smart-thing key. On a coding problem it solves it; in a conversation it tells you what to say. Works from anywhere. Change it under **Settings → Keyboard shortcuts**.
- **`Ctrl` `H` — Solve what's on screen.** Screenshots a coding problem and returns the approach, code, and time/space complexity.
- **The `▢` button** (top bar) — start/stop **listening** to a meeting. The green dot means it's live.
- **Type a question** in the box and press `Enter` to ask about your screen or conversation.
- **Smart** — flip it on for a smarter, more thorough model; off for fast and cheap.
- **Hide** collapses the panel to just the top bar. Drag cue around by the **top pill**. Quit with `Ctrl` `Shift` `X`.

The panel is see-through and click-through — the empty space around it never blocks the app behind it.

---

## How it works (under the hood)

cue is an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app. Everything runs locally except the calls to your chosen AI provider.

**The three inputs are kept completely separate:**
- **Screen** — captured with Electron's `desktopCapturer` (full-resolution screenshots, taken only when a feature needs one).
- **Your mic ("You")** — `getUserMedia` → downsampled to 16 kHz audio → transcribed.
- **Meeting audio ("Them")** — `getDisplayMedia` loopback capture of your system's output audio, kept on its own channel so cue knows *who* said what.

Both audio streams are transcribed by the independently selected speech provider (local whisper.cpp, Deepgram, OpenAI, or Gemini) and fed, with an optional screenshot, to your chat model. Responses **stream** into the panel word-by-word.

When Local transcription is selected, cue runs one persistent `whisper-server` sidecar bound to `127.0.0.1` on a temporary port with a random request path. Voice activity detection creates bounded in-memory utterances with pre-roll, and both channels share a serialized inference queue because one Whisper context must not process concurrent requests. Stop immediately ends new audio capture, drains the current queue for a bounded period, then terminates the sidecar.

**The invisibility** is a single window flag — `setContentProtection(true)` — which Windows enforces by setting `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE` via `SetWindowDisplayAffinity`, so the compositor drops the window from every capture path. Windows 10 builds before 2004 fall back to `WDA_MONITOR`, which renders a black box rather than truly excluding the window.

It's the same mechanism DRM apps and Zoom's own toolbar use. It is **not** a GPU trick or a special overlay layer. Set `CUE_NO_PROTECT=1` to disable it while debugging.

```
main process ──┬─ overlay window (frameless, transparent, always-on-top, content-protected)
               ├─ screenshot capture (desktopCapturer)
               ├─ speech-to-text (Whisper / Gemini)      ── "You" + "Them" channels
               └─ LLM streaming (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / Custom)
renderer ──────┴─ the glass UI + mic capture + system-audio loopback
```

## Troubleshooting

**Local transcription says the runtime is not prepared.**
Packaged releases can include the runtime. If you are running from source, run `npm run prepare:whisper` once and restart cue.

**Local transcription says the model is missing or invalid.**
Open **Settings → Audio**, select the model, and choose **Download**. A cancelled download can be resumed. If verification fails repeatedly, delete the partial/model file from the same screen and download it again.

**A large local model is slow or runs out of memory.**
Try `base.en`, `tiny.en`, or a quantized `q5`/`q8` model. Model size in Settings is the download size, not a guarantee of runtime RAM use; larger models require substantially more memory and CPU/GPU time.

**cue has no taskbar icon — how do I quit it?**
That's deliberate; it stays out of your way. Press **`Ctrl` `Shift` `X`**. If the shortcut didn't register because another app claimed it, end the **cue** (or **electron**) process in Task Manager.

**`npm start` crashes with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getPath')`.**
Something in your environment set **`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`** — some editors and terminals do, notably VS Code's integrated terminal. That makes Electron boot as plain Node, so `require('electron')` returns a path string instead of the real module. Clear it and relaunch: in PowerShell `Remove-Item Env:\ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`, in Git Bash `unset ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`.

**A feature returns "403" / "no access to model."**
Your API key is restricted. Most often it's an OpenAI **project key that only allows chat models** — it works for screen/coding help but 403s on transcription (Whisper). Fix: enable audio/Whisper on the key, use an unrestricted key, or add a Gemini key (cue falls back to it for transcription).

**Listening does nothing / no transcript.**
Check Settings shows a transcription-capable key (OpenAI with Whisper, or Gemini). Make sure **Let desktop apps access your microphone** is on — the top-level Microphone toggle alone isn't enough.

**A Custom provider request cannot connect.**
Confirm the Base URL includes the endpoint's `/v1` path when required, the selected model ID exists on that endpoint, and the local gateway is running. Custom provider credentials are intentionally not reused for speech-to-text.

**cue shows up in my Zoom share.**
Set Zoom's **Screen capture mode** to *"Advanced capture with window filtering"* (see Step 3).

## Privacy

- No cue accounts, hosted service, or telemetry. cue collects nothing.
- Your API keys live in a local file (`cue-data.json`) and are sent only to the provider you chose.
- When Custom is selected, its API key and LLM request data are sent to the Base URL you configured.
- Your optional résumé text also lives in `cue-data.json` and is sent with each model request to your selected AI provider. It is stored as plain text; clear it in Settings to remove it.
- In Local transcription mode, microphone and meeting audio stay on your computer. In cloud transcription modes, audio is sent only to the selected speech provider.
- Audio utterances and the current transcript stay in memory; cue does not write captured audio to disk. Downloaded local model files remain on disk until you delete them.
- Screenshots are sent to your selected chat provider only when a feature needs the screen.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. cue is intentionally small and readable — `main.js` (app + capture + AI), `renderer/` (the UI), `src/` (providers). No build step for the source (plain HTML/CSS/JS).
