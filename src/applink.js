// The publik app link: how Iris asks cue what it is doing.
//
// Before this, an assistant helping someone with cue could only see what was on
// screen and whatever had already been written to a log file. Neither answers
// the question people actually report — "it isn't listening any more" — because
// the reason is in memory: a 403 from the speech model, a shortcut another app
// grabbed first, a Screen Recording grant that was never given.
//
// So cue answers questions instead. Nothing is exposed until the user says yes,
// and the transcript never leaves this process; see `describeState` below.
//
// The library lives in vendor/app-link and is maintained in the publik repo at
// packages/app-link. Do not edit it here.

 * outside the window's setContentProtection surface, which means it would be
 * visible in a screen share. For a consent prompt that is exactly backwards.
 *
 * cue's own window matches the rest of the app and stays under
 * setContentProtection, so the prompt is invisible to screen capture, which
